                    <p>BenixSpace AI offers subscription-based services. We understand that circumstances change, and we have established the following refund policy:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">1.1 Monthly Subscriptions</h3>
                    <p>For monthly subscription plans, we do not provide refunds for partial subscription periods. You can cancel your subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the service until the end of your current billing period.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">1.2 Annual Subscriptions</h3>
                    <p>For annual subscription plans, we offer a 14-day money-back guarantee from the date of purchase. If you are not satisfied with our service within this period, you can request a full refund. After the 14-day period, refunds for annual subscriptions are issued on a prorated basis, less a 20% administrative fee.</p>
